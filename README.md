# MoodTunes - AI-Powered Music Recommender

**MoodTunes** is a simple web app that recommends music based on the user's mood using **Artificial Intelligence** (AI).

When a user types a sentence like "I feel stressed" or "I'm excited for summer!", MoodTunes analyzes the emotion and suggests matching songs from **Spotify** or **YouTube**.

---

## How It Works

- The app uses **Amazon Comprehend** (an AI tool from AWS) to analyze the emotional tone of the user's input.
- Based on the detected mood (e.g., POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, MIXED), the app displays hand-picked playlists.
- Built with **Python +**
